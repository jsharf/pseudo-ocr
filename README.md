==========

This program takes in text files that have ASCII art of capital hexadecimal text in a specific format and translates it to regular characters
  
This program analyzes bitmap text images of hexadecimal digits. 

The algorithm was made completely from scratch after spending a few days thinking about the problem.
This code is my solution to problem 3 from the Hackerrank college programming competition "Hackerrank Games".

Here is an example of what an input text file would look like

    8
